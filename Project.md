### Introduction
In the digital advertising industry, businesses constantly seek to optimize their ad campaigns to
improve engagement and conversion rates. However, traditional statistical methods often fail to
capture the true causal eﬀect of an advertisement on user behavior. This project focuses on
applying causal machine learning techniques to measure the impact of ads on click-through
rates (CTR) and conversions.

### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to accurately estimate the causal eﬀect of online advertisements on
user engagement by leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.
Specifically, we aim to:
- Distinguish correlation from causation in ad performance data.
- Estimate the Average Treatment Eﬀect (ATE) – measuring the true lift caused by ads.
- Optimize ad targeting and bidding strategies based on causal insights.

In this project, we aim to develop a causal machine learning framework for optimizing digital ad
campaigns by accurately measuring the true causal impact of ads on user engagement (e.g.,
click-through rate, conversions). Traditional A/B testing methods often fail to account for
confounders like user demographics and browsing history, leading to biased estimates.
We will leverage Double Machine Learning (DML), Bayesian Causal Inference, and Uplift
Modeling to estimate individual treatment eﬀects and identify the most responsive users.
